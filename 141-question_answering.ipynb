        "### What is RAG?\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data.\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model's cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",

        "### What's in this guide?\n",

        "LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we'll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we'll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we'll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We'll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity.\n",

        "1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We'll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this.\n",
        "2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won't in a model's finite context window.\n",
        "3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model.\n",

Using Chain of Thought (CoT): CoT is a prompting technique that instructs the model to \"think step by step\" and decompose complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. This approach utilizes more computation at test-time and helps in interpreting the model\\'s thinking process.\\n\\n2. Prompting with LLM: Language Model (LLM) can be used to prompt the model with simple instructions like \"Steps for XYZ\" or \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\" This method guides the model to break down the task into manageable subtasks.\\n\\n3. Task-specific instructions: For certain tasks, task-specific instructions can be provided to guide the model in decomposing the task. For example, for writing a novel, the instruction \"Write a story outline\" can be given to help the model break down the task into steps.\\n\\n4.

Humans can provide their expertise and knowledge to break down complex tasks into smaller components, which can then be used by the model for further processing.')"
